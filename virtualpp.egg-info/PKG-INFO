        **********
        
        **opencv is a computer vision library**
        
        
        Here we used opencv to detect a specific colour(of the glove),and draw a contour over it and use the glove movements to move the centroid obtained from the operations.This will in turn move the paddle for the game.
        
        The Game is written such a way that there is only a single player and you gotta survive for as much time as possible.
        Before installaton , you need the following.
        
        1)python 3
        
        2)pygame
        
        3)opencv 3.4or higher
        
        (optional)You can integrate this into a projector inside a dark room and it will give good results.
