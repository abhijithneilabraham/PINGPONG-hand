**********

**opencv is a computer vision library**


Here we used opencv to detect a specific colour(of the glove),and draw a contour over it and use the glove movements to move the centroid obtained from the operations.This will in turn move the paddle for the game.

The Game is written such a way that there is only a single player and you gotta survive for as much time as possible.
Before installaton , you need the following.

1)python 3

2)pygame

3)opencv 3.4or higher

(optional)You can integrate this into a projector inside a dark room and it will give good results.
