#opencv :

opencv is a computer vision library used for image processing applications
Here we used opencv to detect a specific colour(of the glove),and draw a contour over it and use the glove movements to move the centroid obtained from the opearations.This will in turn move the paddle for the game.
The Game is written such a way that there is only a single player and you gotta survive for as much time as possible.
